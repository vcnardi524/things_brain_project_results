# Things Brain Project Results
## UCSB Dynamo Undergrads

Our project was to see generate images from a subjects fmri that corresponded with the image the subject was viewing when they fmri was taken. We used the THINGS dataset for this project.  

The architectures we used where LDMs and MLPs.

This repo contains two images. One image contains reconstructions made from fMRI scans, call this image RI. The other contains the ground truth image, call this image GTI. Note that index RI_ij corresponds with index GTI_ij. That is, the reconstructed image found in image RI, at index ij, corresponds to the reconstruction of the image in GTI at index ij.
